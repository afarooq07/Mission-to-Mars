# Mission-to-Mars

In this challenge, the scope is to scrape data with Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres along with the titles. The scrapped data should then be saved in Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and change the design of the web app to accommodate the new hemisphere images.
